# Purpose


This repository is a python and openCV library for image processing . It is an alternative to other image processing toolkits like cv2 , numpy etc.This repostiory contains a variety of code examples for developing different image processing elements with Python.
These scripts helps beginners to get understand image processing with python.



# Description



You need to install openCV first, then you need to install functions such as numpy,matplotlib, so that you can write your code. Because we use pixels in image processing,so we work with matrices.These functions are required for us to perform operations.

[image_processing.py](https://github.com/OguzhanGok51/gluglu/blob/main/Image_processing/image_processing.py)-
In this code firstly,I set trackbar 0,255 then, converted incoming images from BGR format to HSV format.I tried to create an interface using the Tkinter.I set the image clarity in pixels 0 through 255 using the threshold method. Finally,  divide 3 different regions.

[different_threshold.py](https://github.com/OguzhanGok51/gluglu/blob/main/different%20threshold%20and%20image%20variation/different_threshold.py)-
In this code, I use different threshold function and showed them in different windows.

[image_variation.py](https://github.com/OguzhanGok51/gluglu/blob/main/different%20threshold%20and%20image%20variation/image_variation.py)-
In this code , I use different filters and used matplotlib to see the value that colors get in rondom place of the picture.
