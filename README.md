# Purpose


This repository is a python and openCV library for image processing . It is an alternative to other image processing toolkits like cv2 , numpy etc.This repostiory contains a variety of code examples for developing different image processing elements with Python.
This script helps beginners to get understand image processing with python.



# Usage



You need to install openCV first, then you need to install functions such as numpy,matplotlib, so that you can write your code. Because we use pixels in image processing,so we work with matrices.These functions are required for us to perform operations.
